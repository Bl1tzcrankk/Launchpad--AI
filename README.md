# Development environment for creating unofficial Scratch extensions

This is a repo for [my workshop](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/workshop-write-your-own-scratch-extension-tickets-533502218497) at the [Raspberry Pi Clubs Conference](https://www.raspberrypi.org/clubs-conference-2023/) - about how to create your own custom blocks for Scratch.

This repo has [instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), a template extension, and an online hosted development environment, so you can create your own Scratch extensions using only a web browser. No local developmnent tools or other software is needed.

Go to [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) to find a written step-by-step guide, or watch me step through the process in [this video](https://youtu.be/bX9ZqhuxtnI).

If you make something with this, please [let me know](https://github.com/dalelane/scratch-extension-development/issues) - I'd love to hear about it.
